40. Which of the following is only acidic in nature?\\
(1) \(Mg(OH)_{2}\)\\
(2) \(Be(OH)_{2}\)\\
(3) \(Al(OH)_{3}\)\\
(4) \(B(OH)_{3}\)

86. The order of acidic strength of boron trihalides\\
(1) \({BF}_{3} < BCl_{3} < BBr_{3} < BI_{3}\)\\
(2) \({BI}_{3} < BBr_{3} < BCl_{3} < B{\text{\ }F}_{3}\)\\

(4) \({BBr}_{3} < BCl_{3} < B{\text{\ }F}_{3} < BI_{3}\)

Ans. (1)

Sol.

Boron trihalides are Lewis acid. The order of their acidic strength is
as

\[\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ BF_{3} < BCl_{3} < BBr_{3} < BI_{3}\]

In the boron halides, a \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) back bonding arises due to
empty orbital of boron and filled orbitals of halogen.

\includegraphics[width=2.14583in,height=1.91667in]{vertopal_323faf72d9c74adc823626a013b117fa/media/image2.emf}

This \(p\pi\)-\(p\pi\) back bonding has maximum effect in \(BF_{3}\) as
the size of B and F-atoms are comparative and this effect decreases as
the size of halogen increases. Due to this effect, tendency of accepting
lone pair of electron of boron decreases \(i.e.\), Lewis acid character
decreases.

mixture, known as thermite, is ignited to initiate the reaction, when
\(Fe_{2}O_{3}\)is reduced to molten Fe.

\(B(OH)_{3} + NaOH \rightleftharpoons {NaBO}_{2} + Na\left\lbrack B(OH)_{4} \right\rbrack + H_{2}O\)

(1) Addition of \(cis\)-1, 2-diol\\
(2) Addition of borax\\
(3) Addition of trans-1, 2-diol\\
(4) Addition of \({Na}_{2}{HPO}_{4}\)

Ans. (1)

Sol.

\[B(OH)_{3} + NaOH \rightleftharpoons NaBO_{2} + {Na}^{+}\left\lbrack B(OH)_{4} \right\rbrack^{-} + H_{2}O\]

This reaction is reversible reaction because sodium metaborate,
\(Na^{+}\left\lbrack B(OH)_{4} \right\rbrack^{-}\) formed by the
reaction between \(B(OH)_{3}\) and \(NaOH\) gets hydrolysed to
regenerate \(B(OH)_{3}\) and \(NaOH\).

\[Na^{+}\left\lbrack B(OH)_{4} \right\rbrack^{-}\overset{\ \ Hydrolysis\ \ }{\rightarrow}NaOH + B(OH)_{3}\]

If some quantity of polyhydroxy compounds like \(cis\)-1, 2-diol,
catechol, glycerol etc is added to the reaction mixture then the
\(B(OH)_{3}\)combines with such polyhydroxy compounds to give chelated
complex compound. Due to complex compound formation, stability increases
and due to higher stability of complex, reaction moves in forward
direction.

In silica, silicon has large size, so the 3\(p\)-orbitals of Si does not
overlap effectively with \(2p -\)orbitals of oxygen. Therefore, Si=O are
not formed. The tetravalency of Si is satisfied by the formation of
\(Si - O\) bonds, thus it is surrounded by four oxygen atoms.

(1) All the four valence electrons are bonded to each carbon atom by
covalent bonds\\
(2) It is a giant molecule\\
(3) It is made up of carbon atoms\\

(4) \(Pb\)

Ans. (4)

Sol.

In the heavier elements of group IIIA, IVA and V A the \(ns^{2}\)
electrons have extra stability and hence, do not take part in bond
formation. The reluctancy of \(s\)-electron pair to take part in bond
formation is known as the inert pair effect. The inert pair effect
increases as the atomic number increases in the group.

Lead \((Pb)\) is the element of group 14 (IV A) hence, it shows inert
pair effect, hence for lead compounds +2 oxidation state is more
predominant.

resonance hybrid of three structure with a C---O length of more than a
C---O double bond but less than a C---O single bond. Thus, C---O bond
length is maximum in \(CO_{3}^{2 -}.\)

Sol.

Inert pair effect is the phenomenon in which outer shell \((ns^{2})\)
electrons penetrate to \((n - 1)d\) electrons and thus, becomes closer
to nucleus and are more effectively pulled towards nucleus. This results
in less availability of \(ns\) electrons for bonding. The inert pair
effect begins when \(n\  \geq \ 4\) and increases with increasing value
of \(n\).
